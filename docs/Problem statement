Problem statement: 
 The main problem to address is how we will be able to get exact locations of where charging points are placed around Bristol using reliable information to input towards our database. The solution to this is using a reliable and accurate source of public information like Google maps to show us locations of charging points to allow a dedicated and accurate database. Other problems that would be addressed in the further future after completion of the product would be that we will need to realise and solve as a team is how we will be able to update our database as more and more charging points will be introduced. The simple solution is to create a plan for updating the table every 2-3 months as plans will be made by 2030 for the government to enforce Electric cars to be the only type of cars to be sold. If this rule is enforced by 2030 then it is most likely that the number of charging points in Bristol will go up as they attempt to reduce Co2 emissions given from petrol and diesel vehicles. The harder solution will be to have a source that will be updated regularly as to when new charging points are installed around the city. We will also have to decide how maintenance would theoretically work whether it would be us updating the database or if we hired a team of people to do that task instead.
