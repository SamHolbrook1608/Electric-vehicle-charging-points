## Home page (Use Case 1)

## Database page (Use Case 2) - Sam Holbrook
This version of our webpage is v1.0-alpha-0. The following image below shows the use case 2 file. The use case 2 revolves around the use of Visual Studio code, mysql + mysql workbench and npm. It works by the database on the mysql workbench getting called by javascript created in VSCode and being able to display the information on an HTML template thats made into an .ejs file. All the software used is available for use on both Windows and Makintosh OS.
