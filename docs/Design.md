## Wireframe
This wireframe shows the outline of how the website will look. This is a very simple version of how our product will look once it is finished. This is the guide we will be following to create this. The first use case is shown as a simple search engine which the user adds in the desired postcode and the closest point shows up. The second use case is a table showing the status of each charging point
