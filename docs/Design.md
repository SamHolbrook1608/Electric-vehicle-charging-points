## Wireframe
This wireframe shows the outline of how the website will look. This is a very simple version of how our product will look once it is finished. This is the guide we will be following to create this. The first use case is shown as a simple search engine which the user adds in the desired postcode and the closest point shows up. The second use case is a table showing the status of each charging point

The UI of the webpage is really simple and easy to use. It is a simple search engine which is clear and can be accessed on all platforms (PC,Mobile, ect..).
The user can find the nearest charging point and the status with only a few clicks. The UI colour is really pleasing and easy on the eye to make it comfortable for the user. We decided to go with a minimal approach to make it simple and straightforward for the user to use the product.
