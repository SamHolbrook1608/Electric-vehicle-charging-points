# User Interface Design
## Behaviour design
This UML shows how the process works when the user interacts with the webapp and all the background processes that occur when trying to display the results back to the user. When the user enters their postal code as prompted on the home page they will be taken to a secondary webpage that is designed for displaying the correct database in a table layout for the user. When the user is taken to this page the webapp will send a request to the web server which is express to executing the JavaScript attached to the build of the software to start and finish the set query to obtain all the database results.

## Wireframe
This wireframe shows the outline of how the website will look. This is a very simple version of how our product will look once it is finished. This is the guide we will be following to create this. The first use case is shown as a simple search engine which the user adds in the desired postcode and the closest point shows up. The second use case is a table showing the status of each charging point
